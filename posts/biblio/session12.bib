	abstract = {The Landsat global consolidated data archive now exceeds 50 years. In recognition of the need for consistently processed data across the Landsat satellite series, the U.S. Geological Survey ({USGS}) initiated collection-based processing of the entire archive that was processed as Collection 1 in 2016. In preparation for the data from the now successfully launched Landsat 9, the {USGS} reprocessed the Landsat archive as Collection 2 in 2020. This paper describes the rationale for, and the contents and advancements provided by Collection 2, and highlights the differences between the Collection 1 and Collection 2 products. Notably, the Collection 2 products have improved geolocation and, for the first time, the {USGS} provides a global inventory of Level 2 surface reflectance and surface temperature products. Also for the first time, the {USGS} used a commercial cloud computing archi­ tecture to efficiently process the archive and enable direct cloud access of the Landsat products. The paper concludes with discussion of likely improvements expected in Collection 3 in preparation for the Landsat Next mission that is planned for launch in the early 2030s.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the spatial-temporal trends and variability of rainfall within East and South Africa ({ESA}) region. The newly available Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations ({CHIRPS}-v2) gridded data spanning 37 years (1981 to 2017) was validated against gauge observations (N = 4243) and utilised to map zones experiencing significant monotonic rainfall trends. Standardised annual rainfall anomalies revealed the spatial-temporal distribution of below and above normal rains that are associated with droughts and floods respectively. Results showed that {CHIRPS}-v2 data had a satisfactory skill to estimate monthly rainfall with Kling-Gupta efficiency ({KGE} = 0.68 and a high temporal agreement (r = 0.73) while also preserving total amount (β = 0.99) and variability (γ = 0.8). Two contiguous zones with significant increase in annual rainfall (3–15 mm year−1) occurred in Southwest Zambia and in Northern Lake Victoria Basin between Kenya and Uganda. The most significant decrease in annual rainfall (− 20 mm year−1) was recorded at Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. Other significant decreases in annual rainfall ranging between − 4 and − 10 mm year−1 were observed in Southwest Tanzania, Central-South Kenya, Central Uganda and Western Rwanda. {CHIRPS}-v2 rainfall product provides reliable high spatial resolution information on amount of rainfall that can complement sparse rain gauge network in rain-fed agricultural systems in {ESA} region. The observed spatial-temporal trends and variability in rainfall are important basis for guiding targeting of appropriate adaptive measures across multiple sectors.},

	abstract = {Coupling of global hydrologic and atmospheric models is difficult because of the highly nonlinear hydrological processes to be integrated at large scales. Aggregation of high-resolution data into low-resolution spatial distribution functions is one way to preserve information and account for the nonlinearity. We used {HydroSHEDS}, presently the most highly resolved (3″) global hydrography available, to provide accurate control on global river routing through a computationally efficient algorithm. The high resolution of {HydroSHEDS} allowed discrimination of river-channel pixels, and time-delay distributions were calculated for all such pixels. The distributions were aggregated into network-response functions ({NRFs}) for each low-resolution cell using an algorithm originally developed for the 1-km-resolution {HYDRO}1k hydrography. The large size of {HydroSHEDS} required a modification in algorithm to maintain computational efficiency. The new algorithm was tested with a high-quality local and a more uncertain global weather dataset to identify whether improved routing would provide a gain when weather data quality was limiting. The routing was coupled to the {WASMOD}-M runoff-generation model to evaluate discharge from the Dongjiang River and the Willamette River basins. The {HydroSHEDS}-based routing, compared with the {HYDRO}1k-based routing, provided a small gain in model efficiency, for local and global weather data and for both test basins. The {HydroSHEDS}-based routing, contrary to the {HYDRO}1k-based routing, provided physically realistic wave velocities. The most stable runoff-generation parameter values were achieved when {HydroSHEDS} was used to derive the {NRFs}. Routing was computed in two steps: first, a preparatory calculation which was a one-time effort and second, the routing during each simulation. The computational efficiency was four to five orders of magnitude better for the simulation step than that for the preparatory step. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The Okavango wetland in northern Botswana is one of the world's largest inland deltas. The delta is a dynamic environment with shifting channel routes, causing growth and decay of ﬂanking wetlands, and giving birth to islands. Primary island nuclei are formed by ﬂuvial processes and bioengineering, and subsequently grow into secondary larger islands of irregular shape by clastic and chemical sedimentation, and later by coalescence. This article presents classiﬁcations and quantitative estimations of channels, wetlands and islands of the Okavango Delta. Islands were classiﬁed dependent on composition, pattern of composition, shape and juxtaposition. 90 per cent of all islands in the entire wetland were identiﬁed, with a classiﬁcation accuracy of 60 to 85 per cent. Smaller islands of the nucleus types dominate the upper parts of the delta, whereas larger secondary islands are more common in the distal part, a reﬂection of the age of the islands. Islands in the entry valley of the delta, the Panhandle, are larger in the top end – the primary region of recent clastic sedimentation. The overall size distribution of islands in the delta, however, shows no clumps, indicating that island growth is a uniform process over time and space. The total area ﬂooded at least every decade is approximately 14 000 km2, of which 9000 km2 is classiﬁed as actual wetland. Channel meandering decreases from the Panhandle to the distal part of the delta, with the abandoned Thaoge channel as an exception. Occurrence of ﬂuvially formed islands in the distal delta indicates that the water ﬂow and area of inundation must once have been much larger. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
